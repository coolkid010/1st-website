Hello, my name is Sean. I am interested in making and messing around with programs.
I made this website in a year 7 coding club and did the main part (making the homepage)
at school. I then added more pages and things. I know lots of Scratch, some HTML 
and some Python. I then made another website in year 8 using wix (i dont do much on that
website either). I do most of the coding of this website at school because there is nothing i 
can other than make this website (i also have a version of python on my usb). Enjoy my website!
